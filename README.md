## ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction

Using the NestJS course from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) as a basis, I created a simple REST API that can register and log in users, as well as provide a complete CRUD for users' favorite links (bookmarks). I use NestJS as the main framework, Docker + Postgres for quick and easy database creation, Drizzle as the ORM, Pactum + Jest for automated e2e testing, along with other utility libraries. This project is for study purposes; I did it with the intent of reinforcing the concept of REST API, working with databases for the first time (something I had never been interested in before), and delving a bit deeper into back-end development.

## üìã Features

A few of the things this project do:

* Signup and signin users;
* Validates signup and signin;
* Uses JWT to return user data;
* Read, create, edit and remove bookmarks;
* Error handling;
* Tests e2e.
